# Shaders
Shaders are pretty easy to do due to our shader backend that does the hard work for us. All you have to do is make a file in ``./shaders/``. Our system supports both fragment and vertex shaders to change both pixels and vertices. *(for example ``./shaders/example.frag`` and ``./shaders/example.vert``)*

To use them, you have to script them in *(obviously)*. To do so, look at these pieces of code.
```haxe
camHUD.addShader(new CustomShader("example")); //adds a shader onto the camera.

FlxG.camera.addShader(new CustomShader("example")); //ditto but on FlxG.camera.

FlxG.game.addShader(new CustomShader("example")); //adds a shader onto the entire game (persists between states).

sprite.shader = new CustomShader("example"); // sets a sprite's shader to a shader. (only one shader can be added per sprite)

boyfriend.shader = new CustomShader("example"); // ditto but on characters.
```
If your shader contains uniform variables that needs to be set, you can do so like this:
```haxe
var shader = new CustomShader("example");
shader.intensity = 0.4;
camGame.addShader(shader);
```

## Remember that we only support flixel/openfl shaders.
A basic shader looks like this:
```glsl
#pragma header //important to prevent your game from crashing
void main() {
    vec2 uv = openfl_TextureCoordv;

    vec4 col = flixel_texture2D(bitmap, uv);

    gl_FragColor = col;
}
```

If you got a shader from a site called [ShaderToy](https://shadertoy.com), you have to manually convert them to flixel/openfl accepted format.

Here's a sample shader that renders a basic texture.
```glsl
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)
    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;
    // Time varying pixel color
    vec4 col = texture(iChannel0, uv);
    // Output to screen
    fragColor = col;
}
```
We'll show each step to converting this shader into an usable openfl/flixel shader.

<!-- I could use <syntax lang="glsl"> but it looks weird af -->

1. replace ``void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )`` with a simple ``void main()`` *(flixel and openfl do not have any parameters since the coords are defined outside the function)*
2. replace ``vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;`` with ``vec2 uv = openfl_TextureCoordv`` *(or in some cases, add ``vec2 fragCoord = openfl_TextureCoordv*openfl_TextureSize.xy`` before it and replace `iResolution.xy` with ``openfl_TextureSize.xy`` (if the uv value is different than usual))*
3. replace ``vec4 col = texture(iChannel0, uv);`` with ``vec4 col = texture2D(bitmap, uv);`` or ``vec4 col = flixel_texture2D(bitmap, uv);`` *(keep in mind bitmap is the pixels of the camera/sprite the shader is applied to)*
4. finally, replace ``fragColor = col;`` with ``gl_FragColor = col;``

### Keep in mind that this covers the most basic on how to convert a shader from shadertoy.com, complex shaders will need more expertise with handling shaders before converting those.

## <h2 id="shader-compatability" sidebar="Shader Compatability">Important things to note if your shader doesn't work for certain people.</h2>
Avoid using `0.` or `.0` for floats, instead, use `0.0` (ending the float number with an `.0`)
*(despite half floats working on nVidia gpus, other gpus like AMD gpus don't support this feature)*

Avoid using switch cases, and use if statements where possible.
*(switch cases are not supported on macOS or miscellaneous platforms)*

Ints are not recommended when initiating vectors. *(ex, vec2(1, 1) is not supported on certain platforms, use vec2(1.0, 1.0) instead)*.
Instead, use floats where it's expected. Like mod(1.0, 2.0) instead of mod(1, 2)

Avoid using the following types:
- `ivec2`, `ivec3`, `ivec4`
- `bvec2`, `bvec3`, `bvec4`
- `uvec2`, `uvec3`, `uvec4`
- `uint`

as they are unsupported on certain platforms.

Avoid using `gl_` at the start of your variables *(ex, `float gl_Number` can break your shaders)*.

Setting defaults on uniforms is not recommended, since its not supported on all platforms, so please set the defaults in your shader constructor or after initializing the shader.

Avoid using `<number>u` *(ex, 8u)*

Avoid initializing variables with the name `input` or `sample`, as those cause the shader to stop working on AMD gpus or other platforms.

Avoid using the % (modulo) operator and instead use the mod function.

Avoid using arrays. Since some platforms don't support them.
