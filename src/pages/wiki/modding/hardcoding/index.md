# Hardcoding

You don't need to do this, but if you want to, you can do it.

The engine provides a lot of ways to do stuff without needing to hardcode it.

Like custom classes, custom options, custom states, etc.

If you need access to C++ code you can use <a href="../scripting/ndll-scripting.md">NDLL Scripts</a> to do it.
